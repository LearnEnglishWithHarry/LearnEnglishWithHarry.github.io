<h3 id="weather-words"><strong>Weather words</strong></h3>

<h3 id="words-and-pictures">Words and pictures</h3>

<p>Weather, in <strong>meteorological</strong> terms, refers to the daily elements like temperature, wind and rain. In some countries the weather doesn&rsquo;t change much from day to day. In others, the weather can change from season to season, day to day and even hour to hour.</p>

<p>Because the weather can change so much, some people <strong>keep an eye on</strong> the weather <strong>forecast</strong> so they can plan their daily activities - and decide what to wear!</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 1</strong>
So this is what it looks like this weekend, and it&rsquo;s a story of sunshine and <strong>showers.</strong> So the kind of weather that changes from hour to hour, <strong>so if you are popping out for any lengthy period of time</strong>, make sure you have your <strong>brolly</strong>（🌂雨伞 - umbrella） or the waterproofs (raincoats), because there will be one or two <strong>downpours</strong>(倾盆大雨) around across the country.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 2</strong>
Actually, some of these showers - you can see how they&rsquo;re <strong>dotted across</strong> Scotland, northern England, the Midlands too - some of these showers will be heavy. One particular one here, but of course this is just <strong>a</strong> <strong>snapshot</strong> at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and with the clock, these showers will be moving around as well. But they won&rsquo;t be moving very quickly, because the <strong>winds are very ligh</strong>t on Saturday, so if you are going to be stuck underneath the shower you might be stuck underneath it for quite some time before it moves away and affects the neighbourhoods or the towns further on.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 3</strong>
Temperatures a little <strong>on the fresh side</strong>, for sure, around 12 or 13 for most of us, really, particularly in the showers. If you get a bit of sunshine, it may get up to <strong>the mid or high teens</strong> in the south of the country.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 4</strong>
This is Saturday night into the early hours of Sunday. The winds will die down, the showers will clear away, and it is <strong>potentially</strong> going to be quite a <strong>foggy</strong> morning. So first thing on Sunday, if you are travelling, there could be some quite tricky conditions, particularly in the countryside with fog.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 5</strong>
And then through Sunday itself this area of <strong>low pressure</strong> from Iberia, across the Bay of Biscay and into France, will upset the weather somewhat, at least a little bit later on into Sunday.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 6</strong> So after a foggy start, lots of <strong>bright</strong> weather around for Sunday afternoon for most of us. But notice that the weather&rsquo;s <strong>going downhill</strong> across the Channel Islands, the south coast, and eventually the south east of England.</p>

<p><strong>Paragraph 7</strong>
So we could be talking about some quite heavy rain pushing in through the middle part of the afternoon across the south of the UK.</p>

<p>Windy, snowy, wet, hot - how do you describe the weather?</p>

<p>The British love to talk about it so there&rsquo;s no surprise there are many words you can use. Rob and Catherine are here to help you in this week&rsquo;s 6 Minute Vocabulary.</p>

<p>Listen to the audio</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I&rsquo;m Rob&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>And I&rsquo;m Catherine. And our topic today is weather. Now Rob, apparently, British people love to talk about the weather. Do you think that&rsquo;s true?
<strong>Rob</strong>Absolutely, you know me, I&rsquo;m talking about it all the time. And in today&rsquo;s programme, we&rsquo;ll look at some key weather vocabulary and show you how to use it in different types of sentences.
<strong>Catherine</strong>There&rsquo;ll be a quiz&hellip;
<strong>Rob</strong>And we&rsquo;ll give you a top tip to help you learn vocabulary more effectively.
<strong>Catherine</strong>So, on with the show! We&rsquo;ll start by listening to Harvey, talking about the weather where he lives. And we have a question for you at home.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>The question is: what is the weather like for Harvey in spring?
<strong>INSERTHarvey</strong>I live in the north. I love it here, but the weather isn&rsquo;t too good. There&rsquo;s a lot of <strong>rain</strong> in the autumn and winter. In fact, <strong>it&rsquo;s raining</strong> right now. Sometimes it <strong>snows</strong> in the winter. In the spring the weather&rsquo;s usually quite <strong>windy</strong>. But it&rsquo;s lovely and <strong>sunny</strong> in summer.</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>So, that&rsquo;s Harvey. And we asked you about the weather in spring. What&rsquo;s it like?
<strong>Catherine</strong>Harvey said that the weather gets quite <strong>windy</strong> in spring.
<strong>Rob</strong>Well done if you got that right. And we&rsquo;ll talk more about windy weather later. First, let&rsquo;s talk about the rain! Listen to this clip:
<strong>INSERT</strong>         There&rsquo;s a lot of <strong>rain</strong> in the autumn and winter.
<strong>Catherine</strong>In this sentence, <strong>rain</strong> is a noun, so in a sentence, we can say <strong>there is a lot of rain,</strong> or we can add a main verb, for example: <strong>I like rain</strong>. Rob - how do you feel about rain?
<strong>Rob</strong>I hate rain because I like to do a lot of cycling and when it rains I get wet. But the word <strong>rain</strong> can also be a verb. For example: <strong>it rains a lot</strong> here in London; in fact, look out the window: <strong>it&rsquo;s raining now</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>It&rsquo;s always raining in London! And can add a letter &lsquo;y&rsquo; to the end of rain to make the adjective <strong>rainy</strong>. Rob, do you use an umbrella on <strong>rainy</strong> days?</p>

<p><strong>R</strong><strong>ob</strong>No I don&rsquo;t, I wear a coat - more practical.
<strong>Catherine</strong>More &lsquo;blokey&rsquo;!** (爷们儿)</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>More &lsquo;blokey&rsquo;, yes.  So that&rsquo;s the noun - rain; the verb - rain; and the adjective - rainy. The word <strong>snow</strong> works in the same way. Listen to this another clip.</p>

<p><strong>INSERT</strong>Sometimes it <strong>snows</strong> in the winter.
<strong>Catherine</strong><strong>Sometimes it snows in winter.</strong> The word <strong>snow</strong> there is a verb.
<strong>Rob</strong>As a noun, we can say: <strong>sometimes there is snow.</strong><strong>Catherine</strong>Or we can add the letter <strong>&lsquo;y&rsquo;</strong> to make an adjective. <strong>S</strong><strong>ometimes it&rsquo;s snowy</strong>.
<strong>Rob</strong>Good. Now for another clip. Here&rsquo;s Harvey talking about the weather in Spring.
<strong>INSERT</strong>  In the spring the weather&rsquo;s usually quite <strong>windy</strong>.
<strong>Catherine</strong>In the spring the weather&rsquo;s usually quite <strong>windy</strong>. In this sentence, <strong>windy</strong> is an adjective.
<strong>Rob</strong>We can also use the word <strong>wind</strong> as a noun. <strong>Is there much wind today</strong> Catherine?
<strong>Catherine</strong>
There&rsquo;s quite a lot actually, I got quite blown around. So that&rsquo;s <strong>wind</strong> as a noun and <strong>windy</strong> as an adjective, but we can&rsquo;t use <strong>wind</strong> as a verb. You have to use a different verb like <strong>blow</strong>. The wind is blowing very hard today&hellip;
<strong>Rob</strong>
Right. And the word <strong>sun</strong> is the same. It&rsquo;s a noun:
<strong>Catherine</strong>
<strong>The sun is hot</strong>&hellip;
<strong>Rob</strong>
It can make an adjective:
<strong>Catherine</strong>
<strong>It&rsquo;s lovely and sunny</strong>&hellip;<strong>Rob</strong>
But it isn&rsquo;t a verb. You need a different word for that.
<strong>Catherine</strong>
<strong>The sun is shining</strong>, even though it isn&rsquo;t!</p>

<p><strong>IDENT</strong>           6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
<strong>Rob</strong>
And we&rsquo;re looking at weather words. OK, it&rsquo;s quiz time! Are these sentences correct or wrong? Number one. <strong>It&rsquo;s sunning today.</strong>
<strong>Catherine</strong>That&rsquo;s wrong. You can&rsquo;t say <strong>it&rsquo;s sunning</strong>, because sun isn&rsquo;t a verb. Instead, say <strong>it&rsquo;s sunny</strong> or <strong>the sun is shining.</strong>
<strong>Rob</strong> Number two. <strong>There was a lot of snow last week.</strong><strong>Catherine</strong>And that&rsquo;s correct.
**</p>

<p><strong>Rob</strong>
Here comes the last one. <strong>I don&rsquo;t like windy.</strong><strong>Catherine</strong>
And that&rsquo;s also wrong. <strong>Windy</strong> is an adjective, so we need to add a noun here. Say: <strong>I don&rsquo;t like windy weather.</strong> Or, use <strong>wind</strong> as a noun and say: <strong>I don&rsquo;t like wind.</strong> <strong>Rob</strong>
And that&rsquo;s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got those right. And we&rsquo;ve just got time for a top tip for learning vocabulary.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>
We have Rob, and this is it: when you learn a new word for the first time, you&rsquo;ll learn it more effectively if you use it a few times in the first 24 hours. So, if you learn a new word in the morning Rob, look it up again in the evening before you go to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong>Bye!</p>

<h3 id="end-of-session-1">End of Session 1</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for Session 1. We hope you feel  more confident about talking about the weather and know that predicting – or forecasting – it can be, well, unpredictable! That&rsquo;s why in Session 2 we&rsquo;ll be explaining how to use the words <em>may, might</em> and <em>could</em> for probable and future situations. See you there!</p>

<h2 id="activity-1">Activity 1</h2>

<h3 id="the-weather-supercomputer">The Weather Supercomputer</h3>

<h3 id="might-may-and-could"><strong>Might, may and could</strong></h3>

<p>Before we meet the supercomputer, let&rsquo;s look at the words <strong>might, may</strong> and <strong>could</strong> in more detail.</p>

<p>We use <strong>might + verb</strong>, <strong>may + verb</strong> or <strong>could + verb</strong> to talk about the possibility of something in the present or the future, when we are making a guess about a present situation, or we aren’t sure if something will happen in the future.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>I <strong>might go</strong> to the exhi<u>bition</u> at the Tate this afternoon. (future)</li>
<li>He’s travelling in Eastern Europe. He <strong>may be</strong> in Ukraine by now. (present)</li>
<li>We <strong>could have</strong> some problems later this year. (future)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no difference in meaning between <strong>might</strong>, <strong>may</strong> and <strong>could</strong>.</p>

<p>We use <strong>might not / mightn’t</strong> and <strong>may not</strong> to talk about negative possibility.</p>

<p>（不用缩写形式表示概率）</p>

<p>We don’t usually use a con<u>trac</u>tion(缩写) for <strong>may not</strong>.</p>

<p>We cannot use <strong>could not / couldn’t</strong> for possibility in the same way as <strong>might not</strong> and <strong>may not</strong>.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>We <strong>might not move</strong> into the new offices until the New Year.</li>
<li>Our client <strong>may not agree</strong> with our suggestions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="to-do"><strong>To do</strong></h3>

<p>Read this article about the weather supercomputer.  Watch out for words and phrases that talk about future possibilities - then do the activity to test what you&rsquo;ve learnt!</p>

<h3 id="the-met-office-supercomputer-what-it-means"><strong>The Met Office supercomputer: what it means</strong></h3>

<p><strong>(Part 1)</strong>Britain loves nothing more than talking about the weather, so <strong>the Met Office&rsquo;s latest project might be</strong> the most British thing ever. They&rsquo;re building a £97m supercomputer to provide more accurate, frequent weather forecasts. <strong>It will also help</strong> with climate modelling, which is when weather scientists, or meteorologists, use a computer model of how the atmosphere, oceans, land and ice all interact.</p>

<p><strong>It could help</strong> the Met Office forecast the future of our planet’s climate. Read on to learn about some other changes <strong>this supercomputer could also bring.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Part 2)Parties at the newspapers&hellip;</strong>One thing the media in the UK know very well is that British people love a weather story. The Daily Express had more than 10 weather stories on their front page last year! Despite the fact that winter comes round every year, the annual changing of the seasons continues to make headlines in all the major newspapers and across the BBC.</p>

<p>This new supercomputer promises a variety of new potential weather stories. <strong>There might be</strong> a darker side to this though&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>(Part 3)Weather headlines may get more serious</strong>British weather has previously been very difficult to forecast. Britain is an island nation between the Atlantic Ocean and mainland Europe, so if the wind direction changes even a little bit, you can really feel it. It’s also the meeting place for warm tropical air and cold arctic air, so there are lots of complex weather systems.</p>

<p><strong>The new supercomputer will be</strong> a lot more accurate. <strong>There will be</strong> a lot more data available to the media - and <strong>this could mean</strong> that headlines are full of catastrophic – and accurate – predictions!</p>

<p><strong>(Part 4)The Met office will become world leaders in weather</strong><strong>The Cray XC40 machine will be</strong> one of the most advanced supercomputers in the world, when it is completed (in 2017).</p>

<p>To give you an idea:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is more powerful than 100,000 PlayStations.</li>
<li>It can perform 16 quadrillion calculations every second.</li>
<li>At 140 tonnes, it weighs the same 11 double-decker buses.</li>
<li><strong>It will have</strong> 120,000 times more memory than your smartphone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The supercomputer&rsquo;s predictions could change our lives</strong>Weather forecasts are really, really important. Floods destroy people&rsquo;s homes. Airports rely on predictions to help them fly safely. Hospitals need predictions from the Met Office to calculate how much bed space <strong>they may need</strong>, because extreme weather often affects people&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p><strong>(Part 5)More accurate forecasts can also help</strong> businesses - if bad weather&rsquo;s on the way, gas and electricity companies can prepare for increased demand. Extreme weather <strong>could also cause</strong> damage to supply lines so engineers need to be ready to make repairs.</p>

<p><strong>More weather to talk about</strong>Whether it&rsquo;s on the bus, the train, or on social media, we love talking about the weather. However, British people love humour - so you <strong>may see and hear</strong> many more jokes about it as well!</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Sophie.
<strong>Neil</strong>And with me, Neil. Hello.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> Today’s programme is all about the words <strong>may, might</strong> and <strong>could</strong>.
<strong>Neil</strong>Yes, we’ll look at how to use these three little words to talk about present and future
possibilities…
<strong>Sophie</strong> We’ll tell you what to watch out for…</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>We’ll give you a top tip to make your spoken English sound really natural…</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> … and we’ll finish with a quiz.
<strong>Neil</strong>So listen carefully! Now the first thing to say about <strong>may</strong>, <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> is that they are
often followed by an infinitive verb without <strong>to</strong>. And here’s Catherine… Hello!</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>Hello!
<strong>Neil</strong>…to bring us our first example. Catherine, what are you having for dinner tonight?
<strong>Catherine</strong>Well, I <strong>may make</strong> chicken curry.
<strong>Neil</strong>Sounds good.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>…Or I <strong>might have</strong> steak…</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>Even better.
<strong>Catherine</strong>…Or I <strong>could get</strong> a takeaway.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>Not very healthy - but very convenient.
<strong>Sophie</strong> So, tonight Catherine <strong>may have</strong> chicken; she <strong>might have</strong> steak: she <strong>could get</strong> a
takeaway. <strong>May</strong>, <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> with an infinitive show all three options are future
possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>Good. Now those examples were about future possibilities – Catherine’s dinner tonight – but we can also use <strong>may, might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> with an infinitive to talk about present possibilities, like this:</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>I think Jackie likes chicken - but she <strong>might prefer</strong> fish.
I don’t know where Shaheen is. He <strong>could be</strong> at work.
The agency <strong>may have</strong> the information you want.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong>Right, so that&rsquo;s present and future possibilities. Now, we can also… <em>(someone knocks at the door)</em> …er, hello?
<strong>Woman</strong>Oops, sorry – wrong studio!</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>Who was that?
<strong>Sophie</strong> I’m not sure. She <strong>may be</strong> from IT.
<strong>Neil</strong>Or, she <strong>might be</strong> the new presenter.
<strong>Sophie</strong> She <strong>could be</strong> the studio manager.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>We’re all guessing …</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> Yes, well, anyway, as I was about to say, we often use <strong>may</strong>, <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> to make guesses.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> And we’re talking about <strong>may</strong>, <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong>. Now, for negatives, we use <strong>might not</strong>or
or <strong>may not</strong>. So we can say:</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>I <strong>might not cook</strong> chicken curry.
I think that woman is the new studio manager – but she <strong>may not be</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> The short form of <strong>might not</strong> is <strong>mightn’t</strong>, but this is not so usual.
<strong>Neil</strong>…and some people shorten <strong>may not</strong> to <strong>mayn’t</strong>, but that’s unusual too.
<strong>Sophie</strong> Now, we promised you a word of warning…
<strong>Neil</strong>We did.
<strong>Sophie</strong> … and here it is. The negative of <strong>could</strong> is <strong>couldn’t,</strong> but be very careful with <strong>couldn&rsquo;t</strong>when you’re talking about future possibility or future uncertainty. Neil, give us an example situation.
<strong>Neil</strong>Yes. Imagine you’re in an airport. Your plane is due to take off in an hour from now, but
the weather is getting worse – you’re getting worried. You might say this:</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>If the weather gets worse, our plane <strong>could</strong> <strong>take off</strong> late. We <strong>might not take off</strong> at all!</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>Now that’s all fine, but if you say: We <strong>couldn’t take off</strong> – you’re talking about an
impossible situation in the past, not an uncertain situation in the future. So you can’t use
<strong>couldn’t</strong> in our airport example.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> So watch out for <strong>couldn’t</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>Yes. Stick with <strong>might not</strong> or <strong>may not</strong> if you want to play it safe here.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> Now, for questions, you can use <strong>might</strong>, <strong>may</strong> and <strong>could</strong>, but a top tip to make your English sound more natural is to use the phrase <strong>Do you think…?</strong>  <strong>Neil</strong>So you can say <strong>Might Catherine have chicken curry for dinner</strong>? But it sounds more natural to say <strong>Do you think Catherine might have chicken curry for dinner?</strong><strong>Sophie</strong> So it’s <strong>Do you think</strong>, then a <strong>subject</strong>, then <strong>might</strong>, <strong>may</strong> or <strong>could</strong> plus <strong>infinitive</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>Sophie, I think we could be ready for our quiz. Number one. Which is the correct answer to the question: Where are you going on holiday? Is it a) I may to go to Spain or b) I may go to Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> It’s b) I <strong>may go</strong> to Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>That’s right. Number two. Which is correct? The traffic is getting worse, so a) I may not be home on time or b) I could not be home on time.</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> It’s a) The traffic is getting worse, so I <strong>may not be</strong> home on time.</p>

<p><strong>Neil</strong>And the last one. Which sounds more natural? a) Might we have to go now or b) Do you
think we might have to go now?</p>

<p><strong>Sophie</strong> It’s b) Do you think we might have to go now?
<strong>Neil</strong>Well done if you got those right and yes, we do have to go now. There’s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.</p>

<p><strong>Both</strong>            Bye.</p>
