      <description>Weather words Words and pictures Weather, in meteorological terms, refers to the daily elements like temperature, wind and rain. In some countries the weather doesn&amp;rsquo;t change much from day to day. In others, the weather can change from season to season, day to day and even hour to hour.
Because the weather can change so much, some people keep an eye on the weather forecast so they can plan their daily activities - and decide what to wear!</description>
